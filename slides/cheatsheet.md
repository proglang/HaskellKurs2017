# Haskell Cheatsheet #

- A *definition* gives a name to a value
- Names are case-sensitive, must start with lowercase letter
- Definitions are put in a text file ending in .hs
- Comments start with `--` and extend to the end of the line
- Function definitions have the form `f x1 x2 ... = e` where
  - `f` is the name of the function
  - `x1`, `x2`, ... are the names of the formal parameters
  - `e` is the body of the function, an expression to compute the result
- Operators
  - arithmetic: `+` `-` `*` `/` 
  - comparison: `==`   `/=`   `<`  `>` etc
- Automated Testing with QuickCheck
  - Define a property as a  function `prop_...` of type `T -> Bool`
  - `import Testing.QuickCheck` -- in the source file
  - Test by executing `quickCheck prop_...`
- Floating point arithmetic
  - Do not test floating point numbers for equality!
  - Approximately 15 significant decimal digits
  - Test equality with relative check < 10E-15
- Types
   - Every value has a type
   - Numeric literals are overloaded (can be, e.g., `Integer` or `Double`)
   - Naming a value fixes its type (according to Haskell's rules)
   - Argument type of function and actual type of argument must match
   - Type `Double`: double precision floating point numbers
   -â€¯Type `Integer`: exact computation
   - Type signature specifies the desired type (overrides Haskell's rules)
- Function definition by cases and recursion
  - Paraphrasing the mathematical definition
